# wash_in_time

This app was given to me as test by a company named wash in time

The objective was to integrate multiple apis in a single view and handle the internet connection states.

There will be some unhandled exeptions in the app as the time provided for doing this task was only 24 hours.

Features used : 

Getx for state management and navigation
Http for handling http requests
Firebase for login with email
Hive for local database
Lottie for animations
